Please assume that all cache blocks remain clean throughout the simulation
because we are not distinguishing between read and write accesses. As a
result, when a block is evicted from the L2 cache in the inclusive and
NINE cases, it does not go back to the L3 cache. For the exclusive case,
all blocks evicted from the L2 cache must be sent to the L3 cache for
allocation because this is the only time a block enters the L3 cache. You
can treat this allocation in the L3 cache as an access to the L3 cache and
accordingly update the LRU states of the blocks in the target L3 cache
set. This is largely wrong and designing replacement policies for
exclusive caches is quite involved. If you are interested in reading on
this, let me know and I will give you some pointers to follow.
